gedit
=====

gedit is an easy-to-use and general-purpose text editor. Its development started
in 1998, at the beginnings of the GNOME project, with a good integration with
that desktop environment.

You can use it to write simple notes and documents, or you can enable more
advanced features that are useful for software development.
